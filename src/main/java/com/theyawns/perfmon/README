Ideas on performance monitoring

- Have some sort of bucket, perhaps every 10 seconds, to check sizes/lengths
- Have various counters per structure

- For Queue:
    - Report incoming rate (bucketed counter), outgoing rate (bucketed counter), high water mark

- For Map
    - Report writes per interval (put / update), reads (get)



SimpleCounter    int
BucketedCounter  int interval #, long value

Always accumulate in a SimpleCounter, then when interval pops, add that to BC list and reset Simple

BCMap

key: attribute    value:  BucketedCounter

Attribute might also be compound,
    Structure type: Map, Queue
    Structure name: PendingTransactions
    Access:   Reads
